### Problem Explanation:

We are given two tables: 
1. **Employees** - contains `employee_id` and `name`, where `employee_id` is unique.
2. **Salaries** - contains `employee_id` and `salary`, where `employee_id` is also unique.

The goal is to find the employees who have missing information. An employee is considered to have missing information if:
- They exist in the `Employees` table but do not have an entry in the `Salaries` table (i.e., their salary is missing).
- They exist in the `Salaries` table but do not have an entry in the `Employees` table (i.e., their name is missing).

We need to return the `employee_id` of these employees, ordered in ascending order.

### Solution Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to consider employees with missing names or missing salaries. We'll accomplish this with SQL queries using **JOIN** operations.

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Find Employees with Missing Salaries:**
   - We perform a **LEFT JOIN** between the `Employees` and `Salaries` tables. This will give us all employees from the `Employees` table, and the corresponding salaries (if available) from the `Salaries` table.
   - If the salary for an employee is missing (i.e., `s.salary IS NULL`), we know the employee's salary is missing.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT e.employee_id
   FROM Employees e
   LEFT JOIN Salaries s
   ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
   WHERE s.salary IS NULL
   ```

2. **Find Employees with Missing Names:**
   - We perform a **RIGHT JOIN** between the `Employees` and `Salaries` tables. This will give us all employees from the `Salaries` table, and the corresponding names (if available) from the `Employees` table.
   - If the name for an employee is missing (i.e., `e.name IS NULL`), we know the employee's name is missing.
   
   ```sql
   SELECT s.employee_id
   FROM Employees e
   RIGHT JOIN Salaries s
   ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
   WHERE e.name IS NULL
   ```

3. **Combine Results with UNION:**
   - To get all employees with either missing salaries or missing names, we combine both results using the **UNION** operator.
   - **UNION** ensures that we only get unique `employee_id` values (removes duplicates if any).

4. **Order the Results:**
   - Finally, we order the resulting `employee_id` values in ascending order using `ORDER BY`.

### Final Query:

```sql
SELECT 
    e.employee_id
FROM 
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN 
    Salaries s
ON 
    e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE 
    s.salary IS NULL

UNION

SELECT 
    s.employee_id
FROM 
    Employees e
RIGHT JOIN 
    Salaries s
ON 
    e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE 
    e.name IS NULL

ORDER BY 
    employee_id;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **First SELECT block:**
   - This part identifies employees who are in the `Employees` table but do not have corresponding salary records in the `Salaries` table.

2. **Second SELECT block:**
   - This part identifies employees who are in the `Salaries` table but do not have corresponding name records in the `Employees` table.

3. **UNION**: Combines both result sets, ensuring there are no duplicate `employee_id`s.

4. **ORDER BY**: Ensures that the output is sorted by `employee_id` in ascending order.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:

#### Employees Table:
```
| employee_id | name     |
|-------------|----------|
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
```

#### Salaries Table:

```
| employee_id | salary   |
|-------------|----------|
| 5           | 76071    |
| 1           | 22517    |
| 4           | 63539    |
```

- Employee 1 is missing from the `Employees` table (missing name).
- Employee 2 is missing from the `Salaries` table (missing salary).

**Output:**

```
| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 2           |
```
Thus, employees 1 and 2 have missing information.
