To find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders, we need to follow these steps:

### Plan:

1. **Group the records** by `customer_number` to count the number of orders each customer placed.
2. **Sort** the customers based on the count of orders in descending order.
3. **Return the customer(s)** who placed the highest number of orders.

### SQL Query:

Hereâ€™s the SQL query to solve this problem:

```sql
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation:

- `GROUP BY customer_number`: Groups all the records by customer.
- `COUNT(order_number)`: Counts the number of orders each customer has placed.
- `ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC`: Orders the result by the count of orders in descending order so that the customer with the highest number of orders comes first.
- `LIMIT 1`: Limits the result to the customer with the highest count.
