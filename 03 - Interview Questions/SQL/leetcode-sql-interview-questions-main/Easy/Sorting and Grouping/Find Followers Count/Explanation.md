### Problem Explanation

You are given a table named `Followers` which tracks the relationships between users and their followers on a social media platform. Each row in the table indicates that a `follower_id` follows a `user_id`.

Your task is to calculate the number of followers each user has and return the results ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

### Solution Explanation

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Group by User**: Aggregate the data by `user_id` to count the number of followers for each user.

2. **Count Followers**: Use the `COUNT` function to count how many times each `user_id` appears in the `follower_id` column.

3. **Order the Results**: Sort the results by `user_id` in ascending order to meet the output requirement.

Hereâ€™s the SQL query that implements this solution:

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM Followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id ASC;
```

**Explanation of the Query**:

1. **`SELECT user_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count`**:
   - `user_id`: The ID of the user for whom you are calculating the number of followers.
   - `COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count`: Counts the number of followers for each user and labels this count as `followers_count`.

2. **`FROM Followers`**:
   - Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.

3. **`GROUP BY user_id`**:
   - Groups the rows by `user_id`, so that the `COUNT` function calculates the number of followers for each distinct user.

4. **`ORDER BY user_id ASC`**:
   - Sorts the results by `user_id` in ascending order to ensure the output meets the requirement.

This query provides a result table with two columns: `user_id` and `followers_count`. Each row in the result table represents a user and the count of their followers, ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.
