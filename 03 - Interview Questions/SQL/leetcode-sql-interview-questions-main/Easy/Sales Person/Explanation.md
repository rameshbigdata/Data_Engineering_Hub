To solve this problem, we need to find the names of all salespersons who did not have any orders related to the company named "RED". 

Here are the steps to get the desired result:

1. **Identify the company with the name "RED"** from the `Company` table.
2. **Identify the salespersons who have made orders** to the company "RED" from the `Orders` table.
3. **Exclude these salespersons** from the list of all salespersons in the `SalesPerson` table.

The logic can be implemented using a `LEFT JOIN` or a subquery to find salespersons without orders to "RED". Let's use a subquery for simplicity.

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM SalesPerson
WHERE sales_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sales_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE com_id = (
        SELECT com_id
        FROM Company
        WHERE name = 'RED'
    )
);
```

### Explanation:
- First, we find the `com_id` of the company named "RED" from the `Company` table.
- Then, we use this `com_id` to find the `sales_id` of salespersons who have made orders to the company "RED" in the `Orders` table.
- Finally, we select all the `sales_id` from the `SalesPerson` table that are **not** in the list of salespersons who have made orders to "RED" (using `NOT IN`).

This query will return the names of all salespersons who did not have any orders with the company named "RED".
