To determine if three line segments can form a triangle, you need to check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. According to the theorem, three lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) can form a triangle if and only if they meet all three of the following conditions:

1. \(x + y > z\)
2. \(x + z > y\)
3. \(y + z > x\)

If all these conditions are satisfied, the segments can form a triangle; otherwise, they cannot.

### SQL Solution

To implement this logic in SQL, you can use a `CASE` statement to evaluate whether the given lengths can form a triangle. Here's how you can construct the query:

```sql
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z,
    CASE 
        WHEN (x + y > z) AND (x + z > y) AND (y + z > x) THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT Clause**: This part specifies the columns to be included in the result.
  - `x`, `y`, `z`: These are the lengths of the line segments.
  - `CASE` statement: This evaluates whether the segments can form a triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem.

- **CASE Statement**:
  - **WHEN Clause**: Checks if the three conditions of the triangle inequality are met.
    - `(x + y > z)`: Sum of two sides must be greater than the third side.
    - `(x + z > y)`: Sum of the other two sides must be greater than the remaining side.
    - `(y + z > x)`: Sum of the other two sides must be greater than the remaining side.
  - **THEN 'Yes'**: If all conditions are true, it returns 'Yes'.
  - **ELSE 'No'**: If any condition fails, it returns 'No'.

### Example

For the provided example:

**Input:**
```sql
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
```

**Output:**
```sql
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+
```

- For the first set of line segments (13, 15, 30), the sum of two sides (13 + 15 = 28) is not greater than the third side (30), so it cannot form a triangle.
- For the second set of line segments (10, 20, 15), all conditions are satisfied, so it can form a triangle.

This query efficiently checks each set of line segments and determines if they can form a triangle, providing the result as specified.
