To solve the problem of identifying the primary department for each employee or their sole department if they have only one, we can break it down into the following steps:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Identify Primary Departments**:
   - For employees who have a primary department (i.e., `primary_flag = 'Y'`), select their primary department.

2. **Handle Employees with Only One Department**:
   - For employees who have only one department, report that department as their primary department. 

### SQL Solution

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this with SQL:

1. **Select Primary Departments**:
   - Directly select departments where `primary_flag` is `'Y'`.

2. **Handle Employees with Only One Department**:
   - For employees without a primary department (where `primary_flag` is `'N'` for all their records), select their only department.

The SQL query that accomplishes this is:

```sql
SELECT
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.department_id
FROM
    Employee e1
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT employee_id
     FROM Employee
     WHERE primary_flag = 'Y') e2
ON
    e1.employee_id = e2.employee_id
WHERE
    e2.employee_id IS NOT NULL
    OR e1.department_id = (
        SELECT department_id
        FROM Employee
        WHERE employee_id = e1.employee_id
    );
```

### Explanation

1. **Join with Primary Departments**:
   - `LEFT JOIN` the table with a subquery that selects employees who have a primary department (where `primary_flag = 'Y'`).
   - This join helps identify which employees already have a designated primary department.

2. **Filter Results**:
   - `WHERE e2.employee_id IS NOT NULL`: Ensures that we select employees who have a primary department.
   - `OR e1.department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM Employee WHERE employee_id = e1.employee_id)`: For employees without a primary department, this subquery selects their single department.
