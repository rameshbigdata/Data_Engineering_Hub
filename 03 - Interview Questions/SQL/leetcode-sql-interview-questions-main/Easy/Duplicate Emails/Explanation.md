To solve this problem, we need to find the duplicate email addresses in the `Person` table. The `email` column might have multiple records with the same value, and we want to return only those that appear more than once.

We can achieve this by using SQL's `GROUP BY` clause along with the `HAVING` clause. Here's the approach:

1. **Group the rows by the `email` field**: This helps us group together all rows with the same email.
2. **Count the occurrences of each email**: By using the `COUNT` function, we can determine how many times each email appears.
3. **Filter the results**: Use the `HAVING` clause to filter the emails that appear more than once (i.e., the count is greater than 1).

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT email AS Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;
```

### Explanation:

1. **`GROUP BY email`**: This groups the rows by each unique email.
2. **`COUNT(email)`**: This counts how many times each email appears in the table.
3. **`HAVING COUNT(email) > 1`**: This filters the grouped emails to include only those that appear more than once.

### Example Execution:

For the input:

```
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
```

The query will return:

```
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
```

This indicates that `a@b.com` is the duplicate email in the table.
