### Problem Explanation:

You are given a table called `Patients` that contains three columns:
- `patient_id`: An integer representing a unique ID for each patient (primary key).
- `patient_name`: A string representing the name of the patient.
- `conditions`: A string containing the list of medical conditions for the patient, separated by spaces. A patient may have 0 or more conditions.

The task is to identify patients who have a condition related to **Type I Diabetes**, which always starts with the prefix **`DIAB1`**.

### Example:

#### Input:
The input `Patients` table looks like this:
```
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |
```
#### Output:
The expected output is:
```
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
```
### Explanation:

- **Bob (patient_id: 3)** has the condition "DIAB100", which starts with the prefix `DIAB1`, so Bob is included.
- **George (patient_id: 4)** has the condition "DIAB100", so George is also included.
- Other patients either don't have the `DIAB1` condition or have unrelated conditions.

### Solution Explanation:

The challenge here is to search for conditions that begin with `DIAB1`. The `LIKE` operator in SQL is used to perform pattern matching, and we can use it to search for the `DIAB1` prefix in different positions within the `conditions` column. 

Since conditions are space-separated, we need to account for the possibility of the `DIAB1` prefix appearing:
- At the start of the string (e.g., "DIAB100 MYOP").
- In the middle of the string (e.g., "ACNE DIAB100").
- At the end of the string.
- It could also be the only condition present.

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
FROM Patients
WHERE conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%'  
   OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'   
   OR conditions LIKE '% DIAB1'   
   OR conditions = 'DIAB1';
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions**:
   - We select the columns `patient_id`, `patient_name`, and `conditions` because we need to return these for patients who have Type I Diabetes.

2. **WHERE conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%'**:
   - This matches the case where "DIAB1" appears **in the middle** of the conditions string, but not at the start or end (e.g., "ACNE DIAB100").

3. **OR conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'**:
   - This matches the case where "DIAB1" appears **at the beginning** of the string (e.g., "DIAB100 MYOP").

4. **OR conditions LIKE '% DIAB1'**:
   - This matches the case where "DIAB1" appears **at the end** of the conditions string (though this case is unlikely, it covers all possibilities).

5. **OR conditions = 'DIAB1'**:
   - This handles the case where **'DIAB1'** is the **only condition** listed in the conditions column.

### Output:

For the input `Patients` table:
```
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |
```
The output will be:
```
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
```
This ensures that we retrieve all patients who have a condition starting with `DIAB1`, regardless of where in the string the condition appears.
