The provided query solves the problem of finding products that are both low fat and recyclable.

### Explanation:

1. **Table:**
   - We have a `Products` table with three columns: `product_id`, `low_fats`, and `recyclable`.
   - `product_id` is an integer that uniquely identifies each product (primary key).
   - `low_fats` and `recyclable` are `ENUM` types that take values `'Y'` or `'N'`:
     - `'Y'` means the product is low fat or recyclable.
     - `'N'` means it is not low fat or not recyclable.

2. **Goal:**
   - The task is to find the `product_id` of products that have both `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'`.

3. **Query Breakdown:**

   ```sql
   SELECT product_id
   FROM Products
   WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
   ```

   - `SELECT product_id`: This part selects the `product_id` column, which contains the unique identifiers of the products.
   - `FROM Products`: Specifies that we are working with the `Products` table.
   - `WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'`: This is the filtering condition:
     - It checks if the product is both low fat (`low_fats = 'Y'`) and recyclable (`recyclable = 'Y'`).
     - The `AND` operator ensures that only products that satisfy both conditions are selected.

4. **Result:**
   - The query returns the `product_id` for products that meet both conditions.
   - In the example data, only products with `product_id` 1 and 3 have both `low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'`.

### Example Output:

The result of this query based on the provided input would be:

```
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
```

Thus, the query correctly identifies products that are both low fat and recyclable.
