### Explanation:

1. **Table Structure:**
   - The `World` table contains information about countries with the following columns:
     - `name`: The name of the country (primary key).
     - `continent`: The continent to which the country belongs.
     - `area`: The area of the country in square kilometers.
     - `population`: The population of the country.
     - `gdp`: The GDP of the country.

2. **Definition of a "Big" Country:**
   - A country is considered "big" if it meets at least one of the following criteria:
     - The area is at least 3 million square kilometers (`3000000 km²`).
     - The population is at least 25 million (`25000000`).

3. **Query Breakdown:**

   ```sql
   SELECT name, population, area
   FROM World
   WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
   ```

   - `SELECT name, population, area`: This part specifies the columns to be returned in the result — the country's name, its population, and its area.
   - `FROM World`: This specifies that the query is to be executed on the `World` table.
   - `WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000`: This `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the criteria for being a "big" country:
     - `area >= 3000000`: Selects countries with an area of at least 3 million square kilometers.
     - `OR population >= 25000000`: Selects countries with a population of at least 25 million.
     - The `OR` operator ensures that a country only needs to meet one of the criteria to be included in the results.

4. **Result:**
   - The query returns the `name`, `population`, and `area` of all countries that meet at least one of the conditions.

### Example Output:

Given the input data:

```
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
```

The countries that are considered "big" are:
- **Afghanistan**: Area = 652230 km² (less than 3 million but population meets the criterion).
- **Algeria**: Area = 2381741 km² (less than 3 million but population meets the criterion).

The resulting output will be:

```
+-------------+------------+---------+
| name        | population | area    |
+-------------+------------+---------+
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
+-------------+------------+---------+
```
