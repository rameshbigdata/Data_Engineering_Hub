### Explanation:

1. **Table Structure:**
   - The `Customer` table has three columns:
     - `id`: The primary key that uniquely identifies each customer.
     - `name`: The name of the customer.
     - `referee_id`: The `id` of the customer who referred them (if they were referred). It can be `NULL` if no one referred them.

2. **Goal:**
   - The task is to find the `name` of customers who were *not* referred by the customer with `id = 2`.
   - If the `referee_id` is `2`, that means the customer was referred by customer `2`.
   - If `referee_id` is `NULL`, it means they were not referred by anyone.

3. **Query Breakdown:**

   ```sql
   SELECT name
   FROM Customer
   WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
   ```

   - `SELECT name`: This part retrieves the `name` column of the customers.
   - `FROM Customer`: Specifies that the query is pulling data from the `Customer` table.
   - `WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL`: 
     - The condition checks that the `referee_id` is either **not equal to 2** (`referee_id != 2`) or is **NULL** (`referee_id IS NULL`).
     - This ensures we select customers who either have a different referee or no referee at all (i.e., they were not referred).

4. **Result:**
   - The query will return the names of customers whose `referee_id` is either not `2` or is `NULL`, meaning they were not referred by customer `2`.

### Example Output:

Given the input:

```
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
```

The customers **Alex** and **Mark** were referred by customer `2`, so they are excluded from the result. The remaining customers, **Will**, **Jane**, **Bill**, and **Zack**, either have a `NULL` referee or a different referee.

Output:

```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```
