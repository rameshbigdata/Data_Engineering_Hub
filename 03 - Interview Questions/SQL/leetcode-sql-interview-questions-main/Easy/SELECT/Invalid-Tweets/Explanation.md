To identify tweets that are considered invalid due to their content length exceeding 15 characters, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the `tweet_id` for tweets where the length of the content exceeds 15 characters.

### Explanation:

1. **Table Structure:**
   - The `Tweets` table contains:
     - `tweet_id`: A unique identifier for each tweet (primary key).
     - `content`: The textual content of the tweet.

2. **Definition of Invalid Tweet:**
   - A tweet is classified as invalid if the length of its `content` is strictly greater than 15 characters.

3. **Query Breakdown:**

   ```sql
   SELECT tweet_id
   FROM Tweets
   WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
   ```

   - `SELECT tweet_id`: This selects the `tweet_id` column from the table.
   - `FROM Tweets`: Indicates that the data is being selected from the `Tweets` table.
   - `WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15`: The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to include only those where the length of the `content` exceeds 15 characters. The `LENGTH` function calculates the number of characters in the `content` column.

### Example Output:

Given the input data:

```
+----------+----------------------------------+
| tweet_id | content                          |
+----------+----------------------------------+
| 1        | Vote for Biden                   |
| 2        | Let us make America great again! |
+----------+----------------------------------+
```

- **Tweet 1** has a length of 14 characters, which is valid (less than or equal to 15 characters).
- **Tweet 2** has a length of 32 characters, which is invalid (greater than 15 characters).

The output of the query will be:

```
+----------+
| tweet_id |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
```

This result correctly identifies the tweet with `tweet_id` 2 as invalid due to its content length.
