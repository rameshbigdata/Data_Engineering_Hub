### Query Breakdown

```sql
SELECT name, bonus
FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN Bonus ON Employee.empId = Bonus.empId
WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS NULL;
```

#### Components of the Query:

1. **`SELECT name, bonus`**
   - This specifies the columns to be included in the result: the `name` of the employee and their `bonus`.

2. **`FROM Employee`**
   - This indicates that the data will be fetched from the `Employee` table.

3. **`LEFT JOIN Bonus ON Employee.empId = Bonus.empId`**
   - This performs a LEFT JOIN between the `Employee` and `Bonus` tables based on the `empId` column.
   - A LEFT JOIN ensures that all records from the `Employee` table are included, and records from the `Bonus` table are included if they match the `empId`. If there is no match, the result will still include the employee with a `NULL` value for the bonus.

4. **`WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS NULL`**
   - This filter condition:
     - `bonus < 1000` ensures that only employees with a bonus less than 1000 are included.
     - `bonus IS NULL` includes employees who do not have a corresponding record in the `Bonus` table (i.e., employees without any bonus).

### Result Explanation

Given the example input:

- **Employee Table:**

```
  | empId | name   | supervisor | salary |
  |-------|--------|------------|--------|
  | 3     | Brad   | null       | 4000   |
  | 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   |
  | 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
  | 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |
```

- **Bonus Table:**

```
  | empId | bonus |
  |-------|-------|
  | 2     | 500   |
  | 4     | 2000  |
```

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step result generation:

1. **Joining the Tables:**
   - **Brad**: Has no bonus record, so `bonus` is `NULL`.
   - **John**: Has no bonus record, so `bonus` is `NULL`.
   - **Dan**: Bonus is `500` (less than 1000).
   - **Thomas**: Bonus is `2000` (not less than 1000).

2. **Filtering Results:**
   - Brad and John are included because their bonuses are `NULL` (which satisfies the condition `bonus IS NULL`).
   - Dan is included because his bonus is less than 1000.
   - Thomas is excluded because his bonus is not less than 1000.

### Output

The result of the query will be:

```
| name | bonus |
|------|-------|
| Brad | null  |
| John | null  |
| Dan  | 500   |
```

This output shows the employees who either have no bonus or a bonus less than 1000.
