### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN revenue END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN revenue END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN revenue END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Apr' THEN revenue END) AS Apr_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'May' THEN revenue END) AS May_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jun' THEN revenue END) AS Jun_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jul' THEN revenue END) AS Jul_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Aug' THEN revenue END) AS Aug_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Sep' THEN revenue END) AS Sep_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Oct' THEN revenue END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Nov' THEN revenue END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id;
```

### Explanation:
- **`CASE`**: For each month, we use a `CASE` statement to assign the `revenue` value to the appropriate month column.
- **`MAX()`**: Since each department might have one row per month, we use the `MAX()` function to aggregate the values (since there will be at most one non-null value for each month per department).
- **`GROUP BY id`**: We group the results by `id` (the department), ensuring that each department has a single row in the result.
- The result will have a column for each month with the respective revenue, or `NULL` if there is no revenue for that month.
