### Problem

You have a table named `RequestAccepted` which records friendships between users. Each row in the table represents a friendship acceptance with:

- `requester_id`: ID of the person who sent the friend request.
- `accepter_id`: ID of the person who accepted the friend request.
- `accept_date`: Date when the request was accepted.

You need to find out which person has the most friends and how many friends they have.

### Solution Explanation

To determine the person with the most friends, you can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Number of Friends for Each Person:**
   Each user can either be a requester or an accepter. To find out how many friends each person has, count the number of occurrences where they appear as either a requester or an accepter.

2. **Aggregate Friend Counts:**
   Combine the counts from both roles (requester and accepter) for each person to get the total number of friends.

3. **Find the Person with the Maximum Number of Friends:**
   From the aggregated data, identify the person with the highest friend count.

### Detailed Solution

1. **Count Friends as Requester and Accepter:**

   First, count how many times each user appears as a requester and how many times each user appears as an accepter.

   ```sql
   WITH FriendCounts AS (
       SELECT 
           requester_id AS person_id, 
           COUNT(accepter_id) AS friend_count
       FROM RequestAccepted
       GROUP BY requester_id
       
       UNION ALL
       
       SELECT 
           accepter_id AS person_id, 
           COUNT(requester_id) AS friend_count
       FROM RequestAccepted
       GROUP BY accepter_id
   )
   ```

   In this CTE (Common Table Expression), `FriendCounts`, two separate queries are used:

   - The first part counts how many times each user is a requester (`COUNT(accepter_id)`).
   - The second part counts how many times each user is an accepter (`COUNT(requester_id)`).

   These counts are combined using `UNION ALL`.

2. **Aggregate Total Friend Counts:**

   Next, sum up the friend counts for each person.

   ```sql
   , AggregatedCounts AS (
       SELECT 
           person_id, 
           SUM(friend_count) AS total_friends
       FROM FriendCounts
       GROUP BY person_id
   )
   ```

   In this step, `AggregatedCounts` aggregates the counts from `FriendCounts` for each `person_id` to get the total number of friends.

3. **Select the Person with the Most Friends:**

   Finally, select the person with the highest number of friends.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       person_id AS id, 
       total_friends AS num
   FROM AggregatedCounts
   ORDER BY total_friends DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

   This query orders the results by the total number of friends in descending order and selects the top one (`LIMIT 1`), which gives you the person with the most friends and the count of friends.

### Summary

- **`FriendCounts`**: Counts the number of friends for each person as either requester or accepter.
- **`AggregatedCounts`**: Aggregates these counts to get the total number of friends for each person.
- **Final Query**: Finds and returns the person with the maximum number of friends.
